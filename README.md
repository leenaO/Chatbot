To create a chatbot model we need to:
-----------------

   1- write data on JSON file(you can see my file above).
   
   2- processing data by nltk library.
   
        o nltk (Natural Language Toolkit) is a platform used for building Python programs that work with human language data for applying in statistical natural language processing(NLP).
        o It contains text processing libraries for tokenization, parsing, classification, stemming, tagging and semantic reasoning.
        
   3- use Tensorflow to training the model. 
   
   see the code above for more details, and try to make your own chatbot!
   
   this is mine:
